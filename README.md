This batch file demonstrates how to create a queue for sequential execution of batch files. The script appends each batch file to the queue as soon as it is executed, but waits with executing the main body of the script until it is its turn in the queue. The queue is managed by incrementing the number of jobs in the queue and adding each job to the list of jobs waiting. The script then waits for its turn in the queue and checks if the job in front is finished before starting this job. Once the checks are done, the code can be executed. The batch file also includes a simulated task that takes time to execute.
